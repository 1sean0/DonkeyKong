# DonkeyKong
Developed in Unity, I recreated the classic 1981 platformer Donkey Kong by Nintendo. In this game, players control Mario to rescue Princess Peach from Donkey Kong. Navigate challenging levels filled with ladders and rolling barrels. The game features intuitive controls, nostalgic 8-bit graphics, and increasing difficulty.
